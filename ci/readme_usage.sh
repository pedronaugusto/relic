# relic — README.md's Usage snippet, extracted from examples/usage.zig.
#
# A code snippet in a README is a claim about how the library is used, and
# nothing compiles it. This one is a region of an example that `zig build
# examples` builds AND runs, so comparing this output against the document is
# what keeps the two the same thing.
#
# Usage: ci/readme_usage.sh          # writes the fenced block to stdout
#        ci/readme_usage.sh --check  # fails if README.md disagrees
