# relic — the suite on Linux, from a machine that is not one.
#
# The promises this package makes are about files: an exclusive create, a
# rename, an `fsync`. Those are the parts of a filesystem that differ most
# between kernels, so "it passes here" is not the same claim as "it passes on
# the machine this runs on". This builds the image in ci/linux.Dockerfile --
# Debian plus the pinned Zig plus a git for the fixtures -- and runs the whole
# suite inside it, in Debug and in ReleaseSafe.
#
# The caches go under /tmp inside the container so that the repository's own
# .zig-cache, which holds objects for the host's architecture, is left alone.
#
# Usage: ci/linux.sh [extra zig build args...]
